        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>As the project's highly imaginative name suggests, P2P File Transfer Client is a desktop application that allows users to share files among one another over a network. Once connected to the network, users may mark a file on their device to be shared. This will allow other nodes to see and download the file.</p>
        
        <p>The application was written in C++. Boost.Asio was used for sockets programming and the GUI was written using Qt Framework. The application is cross-platform.</p>
        
    <blockquote class="blockquote">It transfers files. So what?</blockquote>
        
        <p>What makes this application unique is that it uses peer-to-peer technology as opposed to the traditional client-server model. This allows the entire network's load to be distributed among the peers on the network. It removes the need for a central server to provide for each node on the network.
        
    <blockquote class="blockquote">Why do I care about peer-to-peer technology?</blockquote>
        
        <p>Peer-to-peer technology is extremely relevant today, with Bitcoin being a prime example of its various applications. Specifically, Bitcoin's underlying technology, referred to as the "blockchain", is cryptography applied to the peer-to-peer model and is considered to have the potential to disrupt various industries [1].</p>
            
        <p>The financial industry is only one example of this [2,3], with the music industry being another [4]. There are platforms, such as <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, that are being built in an attempt to make the "blockchain" technology more accessible. Ethereum is gaining momentum and is being backed by major corporations [5].</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">Okay. Sorry for doubting you.</blockquote>
        
        <p>It's cool.</p><br />
