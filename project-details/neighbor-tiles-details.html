        <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Neighbor Tiles is a puzzle game for iOS.</p>
    
    <p>The game consists of a grid of tiles. Each tile is either one of two different colors (white and black by default). Tapping on a tile inverts its color, along with the color of its neighboring tiles. To solve the puzzle, the player must make all the tiles black.</p>
    
    <p>The game consists of two different modes: Standard mode and Time Challenge mode.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Standard mode consists of a series of puzzles. After solving each puzzle, the player unlocks the next level.</li>
        <li>Time Challenge mode throws a series of randomly generated puzzles at the user. The puzzles increase in difficulty over time. After solving each puzzle, the player gets a few additional seconds on the timer. The game is over when the timer runs out.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The player also has a few hints. These hints show how to solve a puzzle, but they are available in limited quantity.</p>
